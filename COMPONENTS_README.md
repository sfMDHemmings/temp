# List of components to create

Some good examples of generic / cool UI components. https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/accordion
Not a fan of how all the styling si done here... probs makes sense, I just perosnbally dont like it....
Do we build out own component UI library (which shadcn is) or use a third party + cusotm + Slices with a more modern styling process??
